# 🚀 Improved Block Lookup with Etherscan API

## ✅ Key Improvements

### 🔄 API Call Efficiency
- **Etherscan:** Just 2 API calls total (1 for start block, 1 for end block)  
- **Old Script:** 50–100+ RPC calls per run  
  → **Result:** 25–50× fewer API calls

---

### ⚙️ Built-in Optimization
- Etherscan’s API is purpose-built for block lookup by timestamp.  
- Our original script was manually replicating this logic — less efficiently.

---

### 🚫 Rate Limiting & Stability
- **Etherscan:** Handles high-volume access reliably  
- **RPC Endpoints:** Prone to rate limits, bans, and timeouts — especially public ones like `polygon-rpc.com`

---

### 🧱 Reliability
- **Etherscan:** Stable, well-maintained service with consistent uptime  
- **RPC Endpoints:** Vary in reliability and often fail under load

---

## 📈 Why This Matters
- **Faster Execution:** Seconds vs. minutes  
- **Fewer Calls:** 2 vs. 50+  
- **More Reliable:** Etherscan is built for this use case  
- **Better UX:** Clearer feedback, built-in validation  
- **Cleaner Code:** Easier to read, maintain, and extend

---

## 🧠 TL;DR
The Etherscan-based approach is **objectively better**.  
We're no longer reinventing the wheel — just using the right tool for the job.
